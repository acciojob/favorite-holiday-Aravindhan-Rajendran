	<h1>Dubai</h1><br>
	<p>Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/, doo-BY; Arabic: دبي, romanized: Dubayy, IPA: [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[7][8][9]

Established in the 19th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional trading hub in the early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and luxury.[10] It has the second-most five-star hotels in the world[11] and boasts the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall.

In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian Gulf,[12] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.[13] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub.

Dubai has been a centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[14][15][16][17] Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[18] The city has a population of around 3.60 million (as of 2022).</p>
